# html-challenge

This project utilized web scraping, pandas, matplotlib, and various analytical techniques in order to tackle several challenges presented in this module. In part 1 of this project, the code uses automated browsing to visit and scrape all rows of relevant data from a Mars new site. Each titles and preview pair that live on this site were extracted and stored in an organized list of dictionaries. 


In part 2, a BeautifulSoup object was created in order to scrap another Mars website for over 1800 rows of relevant data collected by Curiosity. This data includes terrestrial dates, solar longitudes, pressure readings, minimum temperature readings, and more. This scraped data was assembled into a pandas Data Frame and utilized to answer the following questions:

-	How many months exist on Mars?
-	How many Martian days’ worth of data exists in the scraped dataset?
-	What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars according to Curiosity’s location?
-	Which months have the highest and lowest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
-	How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

Several graphs were created to accompany and visualize the answers to some of these questions
